# Bank-Website

https://ksmith8888.github.io/Bank-Website/

A mock bank website made with HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Home page has a login form that allows the user to access an accounts page if they enter the username "Fake" and the password "bank". 

Once on the accounts page, the user can transfer money between accounts and the balances are updated. Every ten seconds, an API call to the JSONPlaceholder API populates a fake advertisement with data.
